## For modders:
I recommend using [D9 Framework](https://github.com/dninemfive/d9framework) to guarantee mod compatibility and regular support. More info [here](https://github.com/dninemfive/d9framework/wiki/Miscellaneous#rangedshieldbelt).

If you really want to use this DLL in your own mod (i.e. if you're allergic to external dependencies), follow these guidelines:
- Include the LICENSE file next to the .DLL in the Assemblies folder
- Give me credit, with a link to this page and the above Steam page, in your post.
